## Description 

The Module 20 Challenge requires web developers to create a React portfolio showcasing their projects using the latest technologies. The portfolio should consist of a header, a navigation component, sections for About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and a footer. When viewing the portfolio, the user should be able to navigate through the sections seamlessly without page reloading. The application must be deployed to GitHub Pages, and the project will be graded based on technical criteria, deployment, application quality, and repository quality. The challenge emphasizes using mobile-first design, selecting a unique color palette, and providing an intuitive user experience. To submit the challenge, developers must include the URLs of the functional, deployed application, and the GitHub repository with a unique name and a comprehensive README.

## Usage
Deploying a React portfolio on GitHub Pages offers numerous advantages for web developers to showcase their projects and skills. By leveraging GitHub Pages, developers can easily make their portfolio accessible online without the need for complex server setups. Hosting on GitHub Pages is free and straightforward, making it an ideal platform for sharing their work with potential employers, collaborators, and the wider developer community. Additionally, GitHub's version control capabilities ensure that the portfolio is continuously updated and can be easily rolled back to previous versions if needed. With the ability to showcase live projects, link to GitHub repositories, and demonstrate proficiency in React, a GitHub Pages-deployed React portfolio serves as an effective tool to impress and engage visitors, while providing a professional online presence for web developers.
